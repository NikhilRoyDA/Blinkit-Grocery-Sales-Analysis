# Blinkit-Grocery-Sales-Data-Analysis

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze Blinkitâ€™s grocery sales data using Excel and provide valuable insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and outlet efficiency. The analysis focuses on identifying trends in total sales, average sales, number of items sold, and customer ratings across different outlet types, locations, and product categories. The entire analysis and visual representation were created using Excel features such as pivot tables, charts, formulas, and conditional formatting.
